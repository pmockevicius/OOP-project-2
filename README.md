# Project Description 

OOP Tanks game built with web technologies (html, css, javascript)


# How to play

* Move the player with arrow keys;
* Enemy appears in random positions;
* Avoid collision with enemy as that will count as game over
* Enemy is dropping mines which player should also avoid to stay alive
* As game continues more mines will be on the game stage making it more diifficult to survive
